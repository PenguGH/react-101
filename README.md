# react-101
This is a repo for learning react by following a simple tutorial, adding to it, and exploring react features.

This includes:
1. Following the react tic-tac-toe tutorial.
https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

2. Consuming data from an api and displaying it meaningfully.
The API I used is the NASA Image and Video Library API. https://images.nasa.gov/#/
To display random space related images along with metadata about the images.

JSON:

3. Using React Router to link multiple pages together. Home page, tic-tac-toe page, and api consumption page.
